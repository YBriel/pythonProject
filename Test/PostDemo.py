Throughout her letter to the SEC, she suggested that employee transfers may have involved costs that are relevant to investors and said that the action could be a violation of state and federal law.\nShe also suggested that conflicts of interest could arise around promotion. Musk could conceivably boost Tesla in Twitter\u2019s algorithms or provide Tesla with free advertising. Alternately, Twitter could accept advertisements from competing vehicle companies, earning immediate revenue at a cost to Tesla investors, Warren said.\nWarren additionally noted that Tesla investors have written an open letter criticizing Musk\u2019s focus on non-Tesla ventures and have demanded a leadership succession plan. She added that Musk\u2019s recent hiring of Linda Yaccarino as CEO of Twitter does not remove any conflict of interest due to his continued role as CTO of Twitter.\nThe senator further observed that Musk has appointed friends and relatives to Tesla board positions and noted other signs that the board generally lacks independence.\nShe named several areas of securities law under which the SEC could potentially begin an investigation, most of which concern Tesla\u2019s failure to disclose the above issues.\nTesla is a Bitcoin investor and holds 10,725 BTC ($321.6 million), based on some reports. The firm also accepts Dogecoin (DOGE) as payment for some merchandise.\nMusk had also suggested the integration of Dogecoin with Twitter before he took over the company, a proposal that has so far resulted only in a change to the company\u2019s logo.\nWarren, meanwhile, is known for her anti-crypto stances. She has criticized cryptocurrency\u2019s use in sanctions evasions and the drug trade and has called for investigations into Binance and other firms. She has also expressed direct opposition to cryptocurrency, infamously stating she is \u201cbuilding an anti-crypto army.\u201d", "postSponsorInfo": {"sponsorId": "e4e5b89332ec47049160ae9a487c8092", "userId": "e4e5b89332ec47049160ae9a487c8092", "postType": 1, "userAvatar": "168241357387742.jpg", "userName": "\u5728\u5bb6\u5e72\u561b", "userCustomerName": "nxjdsjjs", "projectMemberNums": 1100}, "hashTags": ["U.S.", "Featured", "Politics", "Regulation"]}
